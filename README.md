### Trafficam

Trafficam is a mobile web app that displays current traffic status from the
nearest traffic camera. It uses HTML5 geolocation to retrieve the user's
coordinates, YQL to get a place name for the given coordinates, and MongoDB
to sort the list of known cameras by geographic proximity, using MongoDB's
built-in 2D geospatial indexing ability. The camera image is retrieved
from [BTIS.in](http://btis.in/).
